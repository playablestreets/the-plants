A flexible FM operator for Pure Data

fm-operator.pd is an FM operator abstraction.  Multiple instances can be patched together for simple to complex FM patches.
The fm-operator abstraction uses savestate to save it's state when a parent patch is saved.  Simple example voices are included as well as a polyphonic example.
